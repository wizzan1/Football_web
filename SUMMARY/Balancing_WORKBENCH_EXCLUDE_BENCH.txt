File Breakdown
run.py: The main entry point to start the application. It imports the create_app factory from the app package and runs the resulting Flask application.
app/: The primary Python package containing all core application logic, models, routes, and templates.
app/__init__.py: The application factory. This file contains the create_app() function which initializes the Flask application, configures the secret key and the SQLAlchemy database URI, initializes the database object (db), and registers all the route blueprints (auth_bp, game_bp). It also includes a context processor to inject the user's currently selected team into all templates, allowing the navigation bar to display persistent team context.
app/match_sim.py: The core simulation engine for the entire game, operating in two distinct modes.
Analytical Mode (get_prematch_odds): A high-speed Monte Carlo analysis tool. It runs hundreds of lightweight simulations to calculate win/draw/loss probabilities. It can be called with team IDs or with modified, in-memory team objects, making it the powerhouse behind the Balancing Workbench. It returns a comprehensive report for both home and away fixtures.
Story-Telling Mode (simulate_match): Runs a single, detailed match simulation with full event logging enabled. It generates a rich, step-by-step log of the match, including explicit calculations for how home advantage boosts zonal strengths (Base → Boosted), designed for the match result page.
MatchTeam Class: A helper class that prepares a team for a match by calculating all key metrics: average base skill, shape, effective skill, and the final zonal strengths (GK, DEF, MID, FWD) that power the simulation. It now also provides the starting lineup in its stats dictionary for UI rendering.
app/models.py: Defines the database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM classes.
User: Stores user account information, including username and hashed password. It has one-to-many relationships with Team and Message.
Team: Stores information for a football team, including its name and country, and links back to its owner (User). It has a one-to-many relationship with Player.
Player: Stores all attributes for an individual player, such as name, age, position, skill, and shape. It contains the crucial effective_skill property (skill * (shape / 100)), which is the foundational metric for the simulation.
Message: Stores private messages between users, with fields for sender, recipient, subject, and body, and flags for handling challenges.
app/routes_auth.py: A Flask Blueprint dedicated to handling all user authentication. It manages the routes for /register, /login, and /logout.
app/routes_game.py: The main Flask Blueprint for all core gameplay features and URLs.
/workbench (New): Renders the balancing_workbench.html template. This is the user interface for the developer's "Simulation Sandbox", where they can edit player stats in real-time.
/recalculate_odds (New): A POST-only, AJAX-driven endpoint that serves the Balancing Workbench. It receives temporary player stats, creates non-persistent, in-memory team models, runs the get_prematch_odds analysis, and returns the results as JSON. This allows for instant feedback without altering the database.
/simulate: Renders the player-facing simulate.html template, which acts as the Pre-Match Analysis Dashboard.
/challenge/<id>: Triggers one or more fully detailed story-mode simulations and renders the results.
/mailbox, /mail/<id>, /compose, /delete_mail: A complete suite of routes that provide a fully functional in-game messaging system.
app/database.db: The SQLite database file storing all persistent data.
app/templates/: The directory containing all user-facing Jinja2 HTML templates.
balancing_workbench.html (New): The template for the Simulation Sandbox. It features a three-panel layout: an editable list of the user's players, a display for the selected enemy team, and a results panel. It uses JavaScript and AJAX to communicate with the /recalculate_odds endpoint, providing instant, real-time updates to the analysis as the developer tweaks player stats.
base.html: The master site template. It provides the overall page structure and includes the main navigation bar, which now contains a link to the new "Balancing Workbench".
dashboard.html: The user's main landing page after login. It now features prominent, distinct links to both the player-facing "Pre-Match Analysis" page and the developer-focused "Balancing Workbench".
simulate.html: The template for the player-facing Pre-Match Analysis Dashboard. It features a tabbed interface showing analyses for Home and Away fixtures, including the "Tale of the Tape" and win-probability bars.
match_result.html: The template for displaying the detailed, story-mode simulation log.
team_page.html: The team management hub. Displays a sortable list of all players on a team and allows the user to select that team as their active team for analysis and the workbench.
player_page.html: A simple page showing the attributes of a single selected player.
mailbox.html, view_mail.html, compose.html: Templates providing a full-featured private messaging and challenge system interface.
login.html, register.html, create_team.html: Forms for account and team management.
search.html, user_profile.html: Pages for social features.
coming_soon.html: A placeholder for future features.
requirements.txt: A text file listing all the Python package dependencies required to run the project.
