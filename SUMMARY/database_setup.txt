Component Descriptions
run.py
The main entry point that runs the application.

app/
The Python package containing all your core application source code.

app/__init__.py
Initializes the app package. It creates the Flask app, configures it (including the database URI and secret key), initializes the SQLAlchemy db object, and registers your route blueprints.


app/models.py
This new file defines the structure of your database tables as Python classes (Models). It currently contains the User model.

app/routes_auth.py
Handles all authentication routes. It now uses the User model and the db object to query the database instead of reading/writing to a JSON file.

app/routes_game.py
Handles core application pages like the homepage and the protected user dashboard.

app/database.db
This is your SQLite database file. It contains all your tables and data.

app/templates/
The folder containing all of your HTML templates for the user interface.
